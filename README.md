# Mission-to-Mars
#### *HTML Web scraping on Mars data to create a Flask web application using Python and MongoDB*

## Overview
This project consisted on writing a Python script to scrape information and images from various Mars websites. Then, I created a Flask web application with a rendered HTML template I created using Bootstrap. The data scraped and displayed on the web app was stored in a non-relational Mongo database.
